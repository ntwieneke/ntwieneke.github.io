# American Movies Abroad
#### - A study of how American movies perform in internationl markets


## Backstory
During my time studying abroad in Europe, I once found myself attend a music festival in a small village in Western Germany.  Here, my travel companion and I met a group of Germans who were quite out of place for a music festival, as they were dressed in surprisingly nice suits.  Once they discovered that we were Americans, they immediately informed us that they were dressed to "look like Matt Damon", and they appeared to be Matt Damon's biggest fan club (mind you, this festival has nothing to do with movies or Matt Damon).  Below is an actual photo from my phone that shows their shrine to Matt Damon.

But despite being one of the strangest moments of my life, this was also somewhate enlightening.
